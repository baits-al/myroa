# Product Short Description
shortDescription: "Lil Fleur is inspired by a heady, surging world of youthful emotions, both happy and sad, and with a great debt to music, the scent is ultimately an interpretation of promise and potential, audaciousness and sincerity - youth & happiness. **INGREDIENTS**: At its heart is a Damascena Rose, sparkling, crisp and enveloping in its sweetness. Top notes of Cassis and Tangerine, add to the crisp sparkle. While Saffron soothes in its warm tones. Blonde Woods, Amber and Vanilla, add notes of sophistication at the base of the fragrance. **100ml-EDP-UNISEX**"
