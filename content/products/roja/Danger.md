# Product Short Description
shortDescription: "Rather than warning those who smell it to stay away, Danger is the type of scent that invites them to come closer. Displaying a hidden moreishness, the juice of four zesty Citrus fruits melt into the velvety sweetness of Peach and Tonka Bean, giving any who smell it a subliminal invite of something worth sinking their teeth into. Prominent aphrodisiac notes of indulgent Vanilla and warm, creamy Jasmine blend into Ylang Ylang and a knowing blush of Rose to create an intensely seductive floral heart. The sensuality and depth of Sandalwood forms the bed upon which this entire fragrance lays, whilst the animalic impulse of Musk beckons a flirtatious come hither.  **100ml-Essence de Parfum-Pour FEMME**"
