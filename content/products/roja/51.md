# Product Short Description
shortDescription: "A scent created to epitomise the luxuriousness of the Roja Parfums woman, 51 portrays an exotic floral beauty that is impossible not to love. A huge note of Raspberry lends a juicy sweetness as the softness of mouth-watering Benzoin wraps around a central note of smooth Vanilla, cutting through the tartness to create a perfectly-balanced sweet centre. Spicy hints of Aniseed, Cinnamon and Clove bring a vivacious warmth that invigorates this indulgent Ambrée accord, which is further livened by the brightness of eight beautiful flowers swirling around a Rose, Jasmine and Lily-forward bouquet. Luxurious wood notes of Casmir and Sandalwood sit closely to the skin, whilst a touch of powdery Orris whispers in the background.   **100ml-Essence de Parfum-Pour FEMME**"
